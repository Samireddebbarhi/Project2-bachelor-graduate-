#### _*Bachelor Graduation Project 2*_

### Descripton project

> To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the attendance process, we developed an application that uses QR codes to record the presence of students at exams.
>
> The examiner generates a QR code that is unique for each exam and displays it on a screen or a paper. The students scan the QR code with their smartphones and confirm their attendance on the application. This way, the attendance data is automatically stored and updated in a secure database.
